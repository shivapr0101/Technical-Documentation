**Module: Dev Tools**

This release includes the following updates for this module.

| Issue | Adoption required? | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| PROC-26610 | No | Fixed a validation gap where removing an entity during a recalculate operation did not display the required "Please fill in all the fields before you continue" toast. Users now see the correct validation message before the entity is removed. Status: Tested. |
| PROC-26559 | No | Deleting a permission from a Permission Group previously executed immediately with no safeguard. A confirmation prompt is now shown before any permission is deleted, preventing accidental removals. Status: Tested. |
| PROC-23236 | No | The entity list shown during Wizard-based screen creation was including internal configuration and status entities not relevant to developers. The list is now filtered to show only relevant business entities. Status: Tested. |

**Module: UI Controls**

No features are developed as a part of the release in this module.

**Module: BOL**

This release includes the following updates for this module.

| Issue | Adoption required? | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| PROC-28941 | No | Reviewed and adjusted the log level of several identified unnecessary log entries to reduce noise in application logs. Status: Tested. |
| PROC-28266 | No | Fixed an issue where creating a record in a child entity failed when data was added via a value-help (VH) query bound to the parent's primary key. The save operation now completes successfully. Status: Tested. |
| PROC-26496 | No | Corrected a misleading error message that was being logged for the ma\_tenant\_q operation. The logged message now accurately reflects the actual condition. Status: Tested. |
| PROC-26011 | No | Investigated and improved a performance issue where the BOL Editor was taking an unusually long time to load in the PATNER\_APP landscape due to a large number of entities being loaded. Load performance has been optimized. Status: Tested. |
| PROC-25394 | No | Fixed a data-integrity issue where child entity records were not deleted when the corresponding parent entity was deleted. Status: Tested. |

**Module: KloTouch**

No features are developed as a part of the release in this module.

**Module: ADM**

This release includes the following updates for this module.

| Issue | Adoption required? | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| PROC-28594 | No | The upgrade banner in MyApps and MyAppsPRC was taking longer than expected to complete because a large number of endpoints were queued for the upgrade process. Upgrade processing has been optimized to reduce this delay. Status: Done – closed. |

**Module: Account Console**

This release includes the following updates for this module.

| Issue | Adoption required? | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| PROC-28605 | No | Fixed an issue where an endpoint's Last Active date in the Login Sessions screen was calculated incorrectly — it was updated whenever a device's FCM token refreshed, even for endpoints no longer active on that device (e.g. after a cache clear). The calculation no longer gets skewed by unrelated FCM updates. Status: Tested. |

**Module: System Admin**

No features are developed as a part of the release in this module.

**Module: Cordova/APK/IPA**

This release includes the following updates for this module.

| Issue | Adoption required? | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| PROC-28969 | No | Verified the recently updated Google Play and Apple Enterprise developer accounts used for app builds, including organization status, console permissions, app visibility, and signing configuration, to ensure continued build and publishing capability. Status: Done – closed. |
| PROC-23868 | No | Fixed an issue where the s\_created\_by and s\_modified\_by audit fields in the mf\_fv\_seq table were not being populated with the correct user data. Status: Tested. |

**Module: Developer AI**

This release includes the following updates for this module.

| Issue | Adoption required? | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| PROC-28877 | No | Getters and setters generated for an entity are now created strictly according to the BBP (Business Blueprint) specification, ensuring generated code matches the documented data model. Status: Tested. |
| PROC-28826 | No | In the app Build Progress page, components explicitly skipped via configuration (conf.json) are now shown with a distinct "Skipped" status and styling instead of appearing as a normal or failed step. The redundant "Export to JSON" button on the dashboard has also been removed. Status: Tested. |

**Module: Business AI**

This release includes the following updates for this module.

| Issue | Adoption required? | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| PROC-29020 | No | Integrated the Business AI policy demo code into the main sprint codebase. Status: Tested. |

| PROC-29014 | No | Fixed an issue where the Proxi chatbot was not functioning correctly on device. Status: Tested. |
| PROC-28985 | No | Fixed a bug where clicking the Chat History button multiple times opened multiple overlapping history pages instead of a single page. Status: Tested. |
| PROC-28979 | No | Fixed the Cancel button in Chat History, which was not responding to user taps. Status: Tested. |
| PROC-28970 | No | Added guard checks against unauthorized file and agent modification within Business AI to help prevent tampering. Status: Done – closed. |
| PROC-28918 | No | Improved the load time of the History button in Proxi, which was previously slow to open. Status: Tested. |
| PROC-28901 | No | Fixed the conversation history screen so it now shows the entire list of conversations. Previously only five records were visible with no scroll indicator for additional items. Status: Tested. |
| PROC-28827 | No | Business AI is now deployed as an independent microservice on AWS serverless infrastructure, including ECR-based container deployment. Status: Done – closed. |
